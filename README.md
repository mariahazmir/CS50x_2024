- **[Substitution](./Week 2/substitution/)**: An implementation of a substitution cipher for encryption.

### Week 3: Algorithms
- **[Sort](./Week 3/sort/)**: A program that implements different sorting algorithms.
- **[Plurality](./Week 3/plurality/)**: An implementation of a plurality voting system.
- **[Runoff](./Week 3/runoff/)**: A program simulating a runoff voting system.

### Week 4: Memory
- **[Volume](./Week 4/volume/)**: A program to change the volume of an audio file.
- **[Filter (Less)](./Week 4/filter/)**: A program applying various image filters.
- **[Recover](./Week 4/recover/)**: A program that recovers JPEGs from a memory card.

### Week 5: Data Structures
- **[Inheritance](./Week 5/inheritance/)**: A program simulating genetic inheritance.
- **[Speller](./Week 5/speller/)**: A dictionary-based spell-checking program.

### Week 6: Python
- **[Sentimental / Hello](./Week 6/sentimental-hello/)**: My first Python program.
- **[Sentimental / Mario (More)](./Week 6/sentimental-mario/)**: The Mario pyramid implemented in Python.
- **[Sentimental / Credit](./Week 6/sentimental-credit/)**: The Credit card validation program in Python.
- **[Sentimental / Readability](./Week 6/sentimental-readability/)**: The Readability index program in Python.
- **[DNA](./Week 6/dna/)**: A program that identifies a person based on their DNA sequence.

### Week 7: SQL
- **[Songs](./Week 7/songs/)**: SQL queries analyzing a music database.
- **[Movies](./Week 7/movies/)**: SQL queries that analyze a movies database.
- **[Fiftyville](./Week 7/fiftyville/)**: A set of SQL queries to solve a mystery in the fictional town of Fiftyville.

### Week 8: Web Development
- **[Trivia](./Week 8/trivia/)**: A web-based trivia game.
- **[Homepage](./Week 8/homepage/)**: A personal homepage built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Week 9: Flask
- **[Birthdays](./Week 9/birthdays/)**: A simple web app to track birthdays.
- **[Finance](./Week 9/finance/)**: A stock trading simulation web app.

### Final Project
- **[TuneScribe](./Week 10)**: A Python program that generates a Spotify playlist where the song titles form a sentence based on a given input.

## Disclaimer

The code in this repository is provided for educational purposes. Please do not copy the code directly for your own assignments or projects. Instead, use it to learn, take inspiration, and understand how to solve similar problems. Academic integrity is important ‚Äî let's keep learning and growing together!

## Why This Matters

The CS50x course has been a foundational part of my journey into computer science, teaching me critical thinking, problem-solving, and coding skills. This repository is not only a showcase of what I've learned but also a resource for others who might be interested in exploring the world of programming. Feel free to explore the projects and review the code!
